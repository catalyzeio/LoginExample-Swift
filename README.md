# LoginExample-Swift

Thanks to @docwelch for this app submission!

This is a basic example of how to use the Catalyze SDK in Swift. This sample app walks you through 
the login flow as well as signing up if you don't have an account. Apps that use invite codes are 
also able to be used with this example.

## Usage

This app uses cocoapods so just navigate to the root of the project directory and run `pod install`. Then 
open `LoginBaseApp.xcworkspace` and run the project.
